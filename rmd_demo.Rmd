# LEVEL 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this.

## LEVEL 2: EXPERIMENT 1

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load data, echo=FALSE}
d.exp1 <- read.csv(file = "../LSC253M/data/QS_Comprehension_2Talkers_Cooking.csv")
```

### LEVEL 3: Methods
```{r analyze data, echo=FALSE}
head(d.exp1)
str(d.exp1)
```


### LEVEL 3: Results
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
